 I want to create a new module for the application called Notes Meetings Reporting this module will have its own tab which sits at the very top of the application next to the other tabs cost planning program procurement.

When the user clicks on new meeting (large plus button in the top right hand corner) a new meeting panel is created below and in this panel the top row starts with the chevron in top left, followed by the the name or the title of the meeting (ser can 1 click edit and autosave thsi title), and then on the right hand side there are four icons 1. download 2. email 3. copy 4. bin . On the next row the project name and address is automatically populated then on the next row below that it's called Stakeholders and the user has five options on the right side, 1. + 2. Client 3. Authorities 4. Consultant 5. Contractor 6. Bin . Underneath that there is a line called Agenda and on the right hand side ther are 7 icons... 1. + 2. Standard 3. Detail,. 4. Custom 5. Empty diamond 6. Full diamond 7. bin then the row underneath this says Attachments with 3 options 1. Save 2. Load 3. eyeball icon

The user may then elect to give the meeting a name or a title then would assess what stakeholders will be attending the meeting and for example may select client and consultants and any stakeholders that are listed in the client group or the consultant group within the stakeholder table would be displayed below the stakeholder line. The schedule of stakeholders that are displayed in this meeting agenda report is the same as the table that is displayed in the stakeholder table master stakeholder table if you will being group subgroup firm the person and after that two more columns being attendance and distribution and they are checkboxes which would automatically default to being in attendance and receive a copy of the meeting agenda, then the user has the option to uncheck any people that didn't happen to attend the meeting or aren't to receive the agenda. The entries that are displayed in this report are static and there is no need for them to be editable. However if the user wanted to add one extra stakeholder for example they could press the plus button and could add one new stakeholder to the list on the fly without going back to the original stakeholder table to update it first. 

Next user would consider the agenda and if it's a simple meeting they would select standard and a standard agenda would be generated below. The standard agenda will be hard coded into the program comprising 8 headings as follows. brief 
procurement 
planning and authorities 
design 
construction 
cost planning 
programme 
other

Below this agenda would be the final meeting header being attachments and the user may elect to select any combination of documents from the document repository (which is visibli in the far right panel) and then click save which would assign those documents to this meeting agenda and schedule out those documents as a document schedule at the base of this meeting agenda this feature is similar to the feature that we have implemented in the request for tender (RFT) and the Tender Recommendation reports (TRR) whereby the user can curate a special selection of documents from the document repository and save them as Transmittals or attachment to be displayed as static lists within these generated reports.  Remember next to the button save there is another button called load and if the user revisits this agenda and changes the curated set of documents they can first click load then add or subtract documents from the document repository then recommit to the save.

The eight report headers that we just listed are all to be displayed in a text dialogue box.  The user may elect to save and ewmail the agenda in this form to stakeholders. 

Later, the user may copy this agenda, by cliding the copye icon in the top right corner, the system would create a copy with and append 'copy to the title'.  the use would then click the cheveron and expand thsi report, click and start typing and populating the contents of the meeting minutes, adjacent to each heading or alternatively on the far right and adjacent to each agenda header there will be three icons being the open.diamond the full diamond and a bin if the user clicks the open diamond then the AI will generate contenct in short form adjacent to that field.  The user would then have an opportunity to review and edit the AI generated content and then click the full diamond icon and have that response polished by AI. 

AI generated content in the meeting contect dialog box, will be gathered from a variaty of sources as follows: 1. Any notes that have been created and dated wtihin the current reporting period. Or any notes that have been selected with a star selection.  2.  Any documents in the Procurement section (RFT, ADD, Evaluation, TRR), that have a date within the current reporing period. 3. Any notes that the user may have maunal typed into the dialog. 

If the user was to select the detailed agenda then the same basic or standard agenda would be displayed but with these differences under the procurement heading there would be subheadings which align with the consultant and copntractor stakeholders that have been identified in the master stakeholder table. Next to each of these headings would be the same open diamond and full diamond and bin with the same functionality that we discussed before allowing AI generated content adjacent to adn in relation to those headings.

Under the authority heading the authorities that have been listed in the stakeholder table would be listed then under the design heading the consultant disciplines or consultant stakeholders that have been identified in the stakeholder table would be listed.  

We will now discuss the requirements for the reporting module which is very similar to the meeting module so if a user was to create a new report there would be a they would click on a plus button and just like a new meeting dialogue is created a new reporting dialogue is created which is identical only there is an additional line underneath the project name and address called prepared for the client name and prepared by the project manager then the stakeholder section is the same and the next section instead of having an agenda the word agenda is swapped for contents and the same standard detailed or custom contents options are forwarded the user clicks standard and the following headings are generated being summary procurement planning and authorities design construction cost planning procurement and other the user can then delete or reorder that contents are and save the report progressively all alternatively if the user had selected detailed contents the same heading would appear (summary procurement planning authority design construction cost planning program and other) only the subheadings of procurement would be the consultants and contractors that are listed in the stakeholder table, the authorities would be listed under the authorities heading and the consultants would be listed under the design heading and so on.

We will now discuss the requirements for the notes module which is different and more simple than the meeting and reporting module. When the user clicks the plus button adjacent to the notes a new notes dialogue panel is created below which has a chevron followed by a title or heading for the note and next to that there's several icons - called Save and Load followed by a star toggle, empty diamond, full diamond, and bin.  Below that is just an empty text field where the user can quickly start dropping and populating random notes into that field. The two buttons called Save and Load actually relate to the user having ability to curate and select a group of documents from the document repository then saving them and associating those documents to the notes.  If the user does associate documents from the document repository to a note then list those documents within the note in a table similar to the table displsyed in the Tender Recommendation report TRR or RFT.  At a later date user can retrieving them adn add or subtract documetns.  Later the usere will draw on the notes and content that has been saved there in either a meeting or report. For example the user may create a note during a meeting and scratch down a whole bunch of random notes then save that note then later on create a new meeting and generate the meeting minutes based on the notes taken.  In a similar manner the user may generate a number of notes during a given month which may be summarising different reports or different discussions that have taken place through the month then they would check the star on all notes that are applicable for that month's report and then when they create the report and generate the content of the report the AI would look up those notes and generate new content and allow the user to then edit that content and then polish that content which has the overall effect of allowing a user to generate a monthly report much quicker. Notes also need to have a copy a copy icon in the top right hand corner similar to meetings and reports allowing the user to create a note with a of information that they envisage will be required multiple times over hence the notes provides the same utility as a template file.
